## What is a Server-Side Scripting Language?

A server-side scripting language runs on the web server, not in the user's browser. This approach allows the server to process requests, manage data, and generate customized content before sending the final output to the client's browser.

## Versions of PHP

- **PHP 1**: Released in 1995 as a set of CGI scripts.
- **PHP 2**: Released in 1997; introduced support for accessing databases and cookies.
- **PHP 3**: Released in 1998; added support for object-oriented programming (OOP) and dynamic loading of extensions.
- **PHP 4**: Released in 2000; added support for sessions, output buffering, and a number of new extensions.
- **PHP 5**: Released in 2004; introduced improved support for object-oriented programming, the PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension for database access, and better XML support.
- **PHP 6**: Development started around 2005, but it was never officially released. PHP 6 aimed to introduce native Unicode support, but the project faced significant technical challenges and performance issues. As a result, PHP 6 was abandoned, and its improvements were gradually incorporated into later versions, starting with PHP 5.3 and PHP 7.
- **PHP 7**: Released in 2015; brought major performance improvements, reduced memory usage, introduced scalar type declarations, return type declarations, the null coalescing operator (`??`), and anonymous classes. PHP 7 also removed many deprecated features and provided better error handling with throwable exceptions.
- **PHP 8**: Released in 2020; introduced the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler for better performance, union types, named arguments, attributes (annotations), match expressions, and improvements to error handling. PHP 8 also added constructor property promotion and enhanced type system features.
- **PHP 8.2**: Released in December 2022; introduced readonly classes, true type for constants, deprecated dynamic properties, new `disjunctive normal form` types, and performance improvements. PHP 8.2 also enhanced enums and added new functions and deprecations.
